# BEGINNER - CRYPTO3 - All your base are belong to us

**50 points**

We found what is sometimes called a “meme” on Earth which says “All your base are belong to us” in an image that is named rather oddly, can you take a look?

Figure out what this is and retrieve the flag.

tU3/k>!{l$TsJ_ap(U.JM(F|6UVs0P0od}Nf[*t;H

Flag format: IGE{XX_XX_XXX_XXX_XXXX_XXXX_XXXX}

P.S. This is the most based challenge btw

Using the clue in the title we can deduce that its encoded in some base.

Using `decode.fr`'s cipher identifier, it tells us that the encoded base is 91 and the encrypted string turns out to be:

>IGE{oh_no_you_got_your_base_back}
