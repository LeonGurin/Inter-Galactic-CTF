**50 points**

Scenario:

There are weird engravings of letters and numbers on rocks in the planet Kimaprim. We've managed to collect one of them. Credit: Byrch B.

Prompt:

Please decrypt the following: 78 76 74 4A 69 7E 63 6E 00 15 6E 74 50 42 68 4C

Flag format:

IGE{XXX_XX_XXXX}

___

Using `decode.fr`'s xor cipher with automatic bruteforce we see as the forth most likely candidate our flag:

>IGE{XOR_1$_EasY}
