The first step in looking around a terminal you stumble upon in the wild is actually connecting to it! So, adventurer, it is time to connect up and dive into this box so we can start to get some intel. Letâ€™s go!

Log into this machine using ssh with the credentials below:

IP address: 64.227.11.108 User: alien Password: Intergalactic2022

Flag format: XXX{XXXXXXXXXX_XXXXXXXXX}

___

Basic `ssh` usage, typing `ssh alien@64.227.11.108` into the terminal and entering the given password lets us log into this CTFs machine we get a sanity check message:

> Sanity Check Flag: IGE{Conn3ction_Succ3sful}

which is the flag.
